  Real-time social media analysis has became popular in the current days, as the topics and sentiment generated will be able to provide meaningful insights on the current subject or event occurring. The form of time-stamped and location-stamped data provides important information, especially when capturing a serious incident. As text data are everywhere, text mining tools such as stopwords and punctuations removal became essential to ensure the words retrieve holds certain meaning. Topic modeling, sentiment lexicons and classification are further steps that can be taken to generate stories from these words itself.
  
  With the presence of time and location tags, government agencies and emergency dispatches can make use of this information (together with words) to make sense of the elevating situation in times of crisis. The location of calls received by call centers can also be mapped out to the first tweeted location, hence measuring the response time and better evaluate the risk level occuring. In this paper, we will be focusing on using a fictional dataset, whereby the historical data of microblogs and call centers will be analysed via text mining tools to determine top events occuring within a fixed time period, as well as mapping out the relationships between microblog users and how the location stamps play a part in evaluating the response time for emergency dispatches.

# Introduction 

Detecting abnormal events ,such as disaster or crisis, from microblog social media has become a trend, as social media has played a pervasive role in the way people behave and think. Nowadays, people are also using time-stamped , geo -located data to share live information about what’s happening in their surroundings, which enables the public, government and researches to sense abnormal events in community more quickly and take immediate actions.

To better analyzing and visualizing social media texts,  several text analytics techniques can be applied, such as wordcloud, topic modeling, network analysis, geospail analysis and so on. In real-world practices, researchers has built various social media text visualization in different domain and lack of an integrated visualization.

In order to build a comprehend visualization dashboard with an interactive user interface, we buit the application based on R shiny - a web application framework to create interactive web applications - and text analytical R packages. 

This paper reports our research and development effort to the real-time social media microblog analysis. It consists of XXX sections. Section 1 provides a general introduction of the paper, followed by a motivation and objectives of the paper. Section 3 provides a literature review of related analytical techniques and Section 4 provides the discussion of analytical methods applied in our analysis and development. Then we will discuss the user interface and application design and provides examples of analysis flow. Lastly, the paper concludes with consideration of future improvement work.

# Motivation and Objectives

Streaming online social media can be used to study crime detection problems. Combining geospatial information and suspicious social media post can help prevent and track the potential crimes, which has been widely used in many institutions. Our research is motivated by the lack of integrated and comprehensive real-time social-media dashboard. We aim to apply appropriate text analytics method and visually driven data analysis techniques in R language and R shiny to provide a handy analytic tool to help users understand the social-media posting through various approaches, 

1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Time-series Analysis by basic statistical and world cloud visualization, which will provide a overview of content being discussed and help to highlight past events that occurred at certain areas;

2) Topic Modeling techniques by Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm will be performed to understand topics generated from text data. And  topic trend and user engagement of each topic will be provided to understand the trend and public response to the topic;

3) Network Analysis will be performed based on the re-tweet relationship between users to discover influential authors. We will also analysis the various centrality methods of the network and their distributions to help users explore and identify social relationships, interactions, and communications;

4) Hexagon Binning Map discussed in research paper (Kam, BARSHIKAR, TAN 2012) will be applied to show real-time location-stamped text distribution in the community. By visualizing color with gradient, users can quickly locate the hexagon districts with the posts information and subsequently estimate the risk level in specific areas.

# Literature Review

Word clouds can provide an overview by distilling text down to those words that appear with highest frequency. In the research paper Word Cloud Explorer (Florian etl 2014), researchers have demonstrated an integrated word cloud dashboard including basic word cloud view, co-occurrence highlighting, term series, information, search panel as well as part-of-speech and named-entities. The extension usage of basic word cloud visualization has been transformed into a powerful tool for text analytics. We will selectively apply the general word cloud exploration techniques into real time social media dashboard development.
Topic modelling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation has been widely used in the industry for text mining. LDAvis (Chris etl 2014) is one of the most popular interactive web-based topic model visualization proving user interface of selection via number of topics and term and topic relevance. In consideration of the nature of social media streaming text, we will further analysis topic relationship with time series and users.

Network analysis has become increasingly popular to detect the interrelationships between actors of all sorts (Jesse, 2017). With the prevalence of social media, network analysis has expanded from real-life networks to the virtual networks in social media. In France and Christpoher's social network analysis of tweets during the Australian 2010-2011 (2011), they used tweets network to identify active players and their effectiveness in disseminating critical information via UCINet (Borgatti, Everett & Freeman 2002) and Pajek (Batafekj & Mrvar 1998). While the static network visualization failed to provide the users’ names and their importance in the graph. To overcome this, we will use visNetwork package in R in our project to create an interactive network and options of various centrality measurements for the users to explore. 

For spatiotemporal microblog visualization, some research has focused on visualization application on disaster events for public response, such as Junghoon et al. (2014), which provided an example of abnormal events detection through microblogs through spatiotemporal visualization, spatial analysis, interactive spatial decision support, temporal pattern and abnormal topic analysis. The heat map is useful in calculating the intensity of data points within the kernel but may have problems in handling large number of point data as discussed in paper DIVAD (Kam etal.2012) which suggested an alternative way by using hexagon binning map. The splitting the existing map by hexagon is an easy approach due to the lack of administrative boundary information. 

# Background and Datasets

VAST Mini-Challenge 3 poses a social media and text analysis challenge to detect the meaningful event reports, evaluate risk level, public influence and suggest team of first response based on location-stamped posts. It provides the collection of microblogs and emergency calls from the event day and geospatial map of the corresponding areas, details as below:

# Analytical Methods

## Data Preprocessing

After loading the related text files, we use textclean, tm, tidytext packages in R to perform standard text preprocess steps, including lower case transformation, punctuation and stop words removal, retweet and hashtags retrieval by using regular expression techniques.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Temporal pattern distribution of the number of posts from various source such as microblog posts vs. call center messages, tweets vs. retweets given the specific time period. In addition, we will apply basic word cloud and co-occurrence plot to demonstrate straightforward text analysis based on its frequency and co-occurrence rate. With the basic line graph and word cloud, the visualization provides underlying insights and situation awareness overview.

## Topic Modeling Analysis

We apply the LDA function from the topicmodels package to create a LDA model with target number of topics and hyperparameter for topic proportions. This function returns an object containing the full details of the model fitting, including how words are associated with topics and how topics are associated with documents. With this model, we further extract the per-topic-per-word probability “beta” and present the top n most common words based on this beta value for every topic.  The second part of topic modeling is to show the trends of the topics over time by assigning each tweet a topic using the document-topic probability gamma. These trends imply the evolving change of topics with time, which useful to detect abnormal distribution peaks in certain time frames. Following by identifying the abnormal topics, we can investigate the tweets of those users most relevant to the topics via user engagement percentages.

## Retweet Network Analysis

By extracting retweets from the original data set, we constructed nodes using the usernames (authors) and edges with directions from the person who retweeted to the person who was being retweeted. With this VisNetwork object, we will be able to plot out the retweets network and draw the histograms of centrality distribution graph. From the distribution graph, we can tell the patterns of the information dissemination. VisNetwork contains different centrality measurements and thus a variety of insights would be derived. Most popular and active users could be identified by in-degree and out-degree centrality. And most influential users can also be detected by closeness and eigenvector centrality. 

## Geospatial Analysis

We first plotted location-stamped microblog data on the leaflet map to visually display the social media contents. The location and messages received from call center were also mapped with the Abila shape file (via extraction and st_intersection of cross junctions) and plotted onto the map.

Next, we extracted hexagon binning map of the Aliba area by using MMQGIS grid layer function in QGIS application and exported the Aliba hexagon shape file. Subsequently, we identified the location-stamped posts intersection with the hexagon and counted the number of posts within each hexagon binning areas. By plotting the hexagon layer with color gradient over Aliba map, we can then visualize the hexagon binning distribution map and identify “hotspots” area.

The plots are governed by time slider to show how the “hotspots” and messages changes across the evening. A more specific analysis can be done by selecting either the microblogs, call center or both.

# User Interface and Application Design


Sample



# Results Analysis and Discussion

The Shiny Dashboard was designed to incorporate interactivity and usability with different parameters for better analysis and understanding of the problem. In this section, we will focus on general analysis of events that occurred throughout the evening.

## EDA and Topic Modeling

### EDA

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/msg_trend.png}
  \caption{Overall trend of Microblogs and Call-Center messages across time}
\end{figure}
```

From initial exploratory analysis, we observe from the spikes that the frequency of microblogs and calls received are in synced. The number of retweets and tweets also corresponds to each other, most likely by people affected during that period of time. 

The top trending hashtags observed are “#POKRally” and “#KronosStar”, while “#DancingDolphinFire” and “#standoff” interestingly appears towards the end of the timeline. A deeper analysis of tagged user shows that top users such as “@ centralbulletin” and “@ newsonlinetoday”, which denotes the official accounts of Abila media outlets that are frequently tagged or retweeted by public.

### Topic Modeling


```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/topic1.png}
  \caption{Topic Modeling Analysis with Time (1st Topic)}
\end{figure}
```

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/topic2.png}
  \caption{Topic Modeling Analysis with Time (2nd Topic)}
\end{figure}
```

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/topic3.png}
  \caption{Topic Modeling Analysis with Time (3rd Topic)}
\end{figure}
```


Topic Modeling using microblog data and with 10 topics of interest across the entire evening shows that the main events occurred were:

1)  Fire at Dancing Dolphin building (from 6:40pm to about 8pm)
2)	Black Van incident and Shooting Standoff at gelato galore (from 7:40pm onwards)
3)	POK Rally event (from 5pm to 6pm, but tweets about it last the entire evening)

A brief approximation of the starting time for these events are denoted with spikes in time-series analysis.


## Network Analysis

We can tell from the distribution graph that the in-degree centrality distribution is right-skewed. There are a small group of popular users in this network. The top 5 users which are being retweeted a lot by other users are AbilaPost(40), KronosStar (39), HomelandIlluminations(39), CentralBulletin (33), and InternationalNews(28). All of them are news media and it shows that people tend to quote information from news media rather than individual tweet users. However, we still have some non-media popular tweet users like megaMan, truccotrucco , FriendsOfKronos and POK.  


```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/network1.png}
  \caption{Network Analysis of Tweets}
\end{figure}
```

For the out-degree centrality, most of them lay on the left of the graph. Only a few active users retweeted many times.  Among them, WiseWords(19), BlueVelvet (18), SaraJane(17), wireHead1122(16) and rnbwBrite(16) are the most active users. 


```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/network2.png}
  \caption{Histogram Distribution of out-degree centrality}
\end{figure}
```


When it comes to the eigenvector centrality distribution, interestingly the 6 out of top 10 tweet users are the same as that in in-degree centrality distribution. Only BlueVelvet, rnbwBrite and wiseWords are different. They’re users who often retweeted from other users but still considered as important in the information dissemination network.

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/network3.png}
  \caption{Histogram Distribution of eigenvector centrality}
\end{figure}
```


## Geospatial Analysis

Given the event estimated starting time, we will filter the time accordingly so as to examine the flow of event as well as response time for call center. The location mapping allows detailed evaluation on whether the tweet message and call message are within the same vicinity and then compared with the timing for each.

### Event 1: POK Rally (around 5-6pm)

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/geo1.png}
  \caption{Microblog and Call messages for POK Rally event}
\end{figure}
```


From the map, we noted on the estimated location of where POK Rally occurs. By observation, there are almost no calls received about the Rally within the vicinity and time range. This shows that the rally was most likely peaceful and not violent or chaotic.


### Event 2: Fire at Dancing Dolphin building (around 6:40pm-8pm)

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/geo2.png}
  \caption{Microblog and Call messages for Fire Incident}
\end{figure}
```


We noted that the affected area has sudden increase in both microblogs and call messages received denoted by the hexagonal plot. Judging from the call message within the affected area, the first call received is at 6:40pm, and is in-synced with the estimated first microblog message related. Hence, the response time can be considered prompt, denoting the severity of the event.


### Event 3: Black Van Chase (around 7:20pm onwards)

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/geo3.png}
  \caption{Microblog and Call messages for Black Van Incident}
\end{figure}
```


Interestingly, the area where the black van first appear is within the Fire incident as well. Hence, these events might be interlinked. The first microblog message and the call center message received are within 1 minute apart, hence the response is considered relatively prompt.

### Event 4: Shooting Standoff at Gelato Galore (around 7:40pm onwards)

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/geo4.png}
  \caption{Microblog and Call messages for Shooting Standoff Incident}
\end{figure}
```


```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/geo5.png}
  \caption{Tracing the Black Van path}
\end{figure}
```


The final event of the evening denotes another serious incident, given the high number of messages (both microblog and calls) received within the same area. We also noticed that the black van hit-and-run incident seems to be connected to the shooting as well, given the call messages locations tracked along the streets until around 7:39pm. Given the call message for SWAT team at 7:44pm, and that the estimated start time for this event is around 7:40pm, we noticed a slight lag in time but nonetheless almost in-synced.



# Conclusion and Future Work

In this work we presented an integrated visual analytics dashboard for public and government analysis of social media data. We applied multiple text mining and visualization techniques for social events response based on text content vitalization, network exploration and spatiotemporal analysis. For abnormal event response, we demonstrated an analyzed flow to verify and examine the dashboard application. For future work, we will research and include more text mining techniques and provide more functional extension to the dashboard, and we hope to apply the concept of the framework design for more real-world text data analysis in response to time, entity relationship, and location.

One of the constraints of this dashboard is it’s not linked with the real-time data, but rather historical data. In the future, an integration between Tweeter/Call center database and the dashboard may mitigate the gap and provide real-time risk alert. Further work also needs to be done for tweets and calls received at the exact same timestamp, as there could be potential overlaps of messages and difficult to decipher which message is the first.

In conclusion, the dashboard highlighted key topics and network relations among microblogs. We also observed interesting linkage of the major events throughout the course of the evening. Hence, this proved to be a potential real-time detection of incident flow for emergency dispatches to be alerted of quickly and dispatch the corresponding units accordingly.
